# hft-asgmt-static-dynamic

## TODO

- [ ] Install `express` and `ejs` npm packages
- [ ] Set `ejs` as view engine
- [ ] Enable an index route `/` that renders content from a index.ejs within that location `views/pages/index.ejs`
- [ ] Set any `h1` headline within the index.ejs file

## Hints

- `npm init` already happend!
- Have you set your view engine, yet?
- Have you set the public folder for public assets, e.h. styles?
