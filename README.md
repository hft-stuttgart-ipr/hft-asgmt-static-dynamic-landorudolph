# hft-asgmt-static-dynamic

## TODO

- [x] Install `express` and `ejs` npm packages
- [x] Set `ejs` as view engine
- [x] Enable an index route `/` that renders content from a index.ejs within that location `views/pages/index.ejs`
- [x] Set any `h1` headline within the index.ejs file

## Hints

- `npm init` already happend!
- Have you set your view engine, yet?
- Have you set the public folder for public assets, e.h. styles?
